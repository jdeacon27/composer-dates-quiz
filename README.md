# quiz-composer-dates

This is a private project (although I am not trying to _forbid_ anyone from contributing).

I was an Eclipse user long ago. I wanted to get up-to-date with using Eclipse (Java) with Maven and git.
So this is a little play project.

It will read a database of composer names and dates and quizes the user. At the moment it won't work. I'm
still finalizing the file format. I'll tag a release when it works.

It is moderately object oriented.
